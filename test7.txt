Sitting in the sun, away from everyone who had done him harm in the past, he quietly listened to those who roamed by. 
He felt at peace in the moment, hoping it would last, but knowing the reprieve would soon come to an end. 
He closed his eyes, the sun beating down on face and he smiled. He smiled for the first time in as long as he could remember.
He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning. That was what made the choice so difficult. 
What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. 
This would have been fine if he were willing to face the inevitable consequences, but he wasn't.
Puppies are soft, cute, funny, and make a big mess. 
Every month or two our family fosters 6-12 week old puppies for a puppy rescue nonprofit organization. We all enjoy cuddling their furry bodies after a clean bath. 
Fresh puppy smell is great. The puppies play with each other and our adult dog. They look so funny when they lay on top of each other and sleep. While puppies can be great fun, they also can make big messes. 4-6 puppies can make a lot of puppy pee and poop. 
It's a challenge to keep the puppies and the puppy pen clean.
Dave watched as the forest burned up on the hill, only a few miles from her house. 
i had it enjoy.
The car had been hastily packed and Marta was inside trying to round up the last of the pets. 
Dave went through his mental list of the most important papers and documents that they couldn't leave behind. 
He scolded himself for not having prepared these better in advance and hoped that he had remembered everything that was needed. 
He continued to wait for Marta to appear with the pets, but she still was nowhere to be seen.
it has good taste.
it was cool to have you with us.
