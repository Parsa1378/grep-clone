It was the best compliment that he'd ever received although the person who gave it likely never knew. 
It had been an off-hand observation on his ability to hold a conversation and actually add pertinent information to it on practically any topic. Although he hadn't consciously strived to be able to do so, he'd started to voraciously read the news when he couldn't keep up on topics his friends discussed because their conversations went above his head. 
The fact that someone had noticed enough to compliment him that he could talk intelligently about many topics meant that he had succeeded in his quest to be better informed.
He heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away. His heart started racing and he bolted into a full sprint. "It wasn't a gunshot, it wasn't a gunshot," he repeated under his breathlessness as he continued to sprint.
She considered the birds to be her friends. She'd put out food for them each morning and then she'd watch as they came to the feeders to gorge themselves for the day. 
She wondered what they would do if something ever happened to her. 
Would they miss the meals she provided if she failed to put out the food one morning?
He ordered his regular breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, hash browns, and two strips of bacon. 
He continued to look at the menu wondering if this would be the day he added something new. 
This was also part of the routine. A few seconds of hesitation to see if something else would be added to the order before demuring and saying that would be all. 
It was the same exact meal that he had ordered every day for the past two years.
The rain was coming. Everyone thought this would be a good thing. 
It hadn't rained in months and the earth was dry as a bone. 
It wasn't a surprise that everyone thought a good rain was what was needed, but they never expected how much rain would actually arrive.
He walked down the steps from the train station in a bit of a hurry knowing the secrets in the briefcase must be secured as quickly as possible. 
Bounding down the steps, he heard something behind him and quickly turned in a panic. 
There was nobody there but a pair of old worn-out shoes were placed neatly on the steps he had just come down. 
Had he past them without seeing them? It didn't seem possible. 
He was about to turn and be on his way when a deep chill filled his body.
Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together. 
Even colors that had no business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the same time. 
How was she going to explain this to the others?
She had a terrible habit o comparing her life to others. 
She realized that their life experiences were completely different than her own and that she saw only what they wanted her to see, but that didn't matter. 
She still compared herself and yearned for what she thought they had and she didn't.
The paper was blank. It shouldn't have been. There should have been writing on the paper, at least a paragraph if not more. 
The fact that the writing wasn't there was frustrating. Actually, it was even more than frustrating. 
It was downright distressing.
There was something in the sky. What exactly was up there wasn't immediately clear. 
But there was definitely something in the sky and it was getting bigger and bigger.
