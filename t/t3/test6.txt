The light blinded him. It was dark and he thought he was the only one in the area, but the light shining in his eyes proved him wrong. 
It came from about 100 feet away and was shining so directly into his eyes he couldn't make out anything about the person holding the light. 
There was only one thing to do in this situation. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a flashlight of his own that was much stronger than the one currently blinding him. 
He turned it on and pointed it into the stranger's eyes.
Was it a whisper or was it the wind? He wasn't quite sure. 
He thought he heard a voice but at this moment all he could hear was the wind rustling the leaves of the trees all around him. 
He stopped and listened more intently to see if he could hear the voice again. Nothing but the wind rustling the leaves could be heard. He was about to continue his walk when he felt a hand on his shoulder, and he quickly turned to see who it was. 
There was nobody there, but he heard the voice again.
Terrance knew that sometimes it was simply best to stay out of it. 
He kept repeating this to himself as he watched the scene unfold. 
He knew that nothing good would come of him getting involved. 
It was far better for him to stay on the sidelines and observe. 
He kept yelling this to himself inside his head as he walked over to the couple and punched the man in the face.
All he could think about was how it would all end. 
There was still a bit of uncertainty in the equation, but the basics were there for anyone to see. 
No matter how much he tried to see the positive, it wasn't anywhere to be seen. 
The end was coming and it wasn't going to be pretty.
I guess we could discuss the implications of the phrase "meant to be." 
That is if we wanted to drown ourselves in a sea of backwardly referential semantics and other mumbo-jumbo. 
Maybe such a discussion would result in the determination that "meant to be" is exactly as meaningless a phrase as it seems to be, and that none of us is actually meant to be doing anything at all. But that's my existential underpants underpinnings showing. 
It's the way the cookie crumbles. And now I want a cookie.
There was something beautiful in his hate. 
It wasn't the hate itself as it was a disgusting display of racism and intolerance. 
It was what propelled the hate and the fact that although he had this hate, he didn't understand where it came from. 
It was at that moment that she realized that there was hope in changing him.
It was a good idea. At least, they all thought it was a good idea at the time. 
Hindsight would reveal that in reality, it was an unbelievably terrible idea, but it would take another week for them to understand that. 
Right now, at this very moment. they all agreed that it was the perfect course of action for the current situation.
It really didn't matter what they did to him. He's already made up his mind. 
Whatever came his way, he was prepared for the consequences. 
He knew in his heart that the sacrifice he made was done with love and not hate no matter how others decided to spin it.
