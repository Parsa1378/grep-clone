It can also be successfully used as a daily exercise to get writers to begin writing. 
Being shown a random sentence and using it to complete a paragraph each day can be an excellent way to begin any writing session.
Random sentences can also spur creativity in other types of projects being done. If you are trying to come up with a new concept, a new idea or a new product, a random sentence may help you find unique qualities you may not have considered. Trying to incorporate the sentence into your project can help you look at it in different and unexpected ways than you would normally on your own.
It can also be a fun way to surprise others. You might choose to share a random sentence on social media just to see what type of reaction it garners from others. 
It's an unexpected move that might create more conversation than a typical post or tweet.
These are just a few ways that one might use the random sentence generator for their benefit. 
If you're not sure if it will help in the way you want, the best course of action is to try it and see. 
Have several random sentences generated and you'll soon be able to see if they can help with your project.
Our goal is to make this tool as useful as possible. For anyone who uses this tool and comes up with a way we can improve it, we'd love to know your thoughts. 
Please contact us so we can consider adding your ideas to make the random sentence generator the best it can be.

Lori lived her life through the lens of a camera. She never realized this until this very moment as she scrolled through thousands of images on your computer. She could remember the exact moment each photo was taken. She could remember where she had been, what she was thinking as she tried to get the shot, the smells of the surrounding area, and even the emotions that she felt taking the photo, yet she had trouble remembering what she had for breakfast.
There was something in the tree. It was difficult to tell from the ground, but Rachael could see movement. 
She squinted her eyes and peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly what she had spied. 
The more she peered, however, the more she thought it might be a figment of her imagination. Nothing seemed to move until the moment she began to take her eyes off the tree. 
Then in the corner of her eye, she would see the movement again and begin the process of staring again.
The opened package of potato chips held the answer to the mystery. Both detectives looked at it but failed to realize it was the key to solve the crime. 
They passed by it assuming it was random trash ensuring that the case would never be solved.
She didn't like the food. She never did. She made the usual complaints and started the tantrum he knew was coming. But this time was different. 
Instead of trying to placate her and her unreasonable demands, he just stared at her and watched her meltdown without saying a word.
