If you're visiting this page, you're likely here because you're searching for a random sentence. 
Sometimes a random word just isn't enough, and that is where the random sentence generator comes into play. 
By inputting the desired number, you can make a list of as many random sentences as you want or need. 
Producing random sentences can be helpful in a number of different ways.
For writers, a random sentence can help them get their creative juices flowing. 
Since the topic of the sentence is completely unknown, it forces the writer to be creative when the sentence appears. 
There are a number of different ways a writer can use the random sentence for creativity. The most common way to use the sentence is to begin a story. 
Another option is to include it somewhere in the story. A much more difficult challenge is to use it to end a story. In any of these cases, it forces the writer to think creatively since they have no idea what sentence will appear from the tool.
For those writers who have writers' block, this can be an excellent way to take a step to crumbling those walls. 
By taking the writer away from the subject matter that is causing the block, a random sentence may allow them to see the project they're working on in a different light and perspective. 
Sometimes all it takes is to get that first sentence down to help break the block.

No! All of the paragraphs in the generator are written by humans, not computers. When first building this generator we thought about using computers to generate the paragraphs, but they weren't very good and many times didn't make any sense at all. 
We therefore took the time to create paragraphs specifically for this generator to make it the best that we could.
Rhonda prided herself on always taking the path less traveled. 
She'd decided to do this at an early age and had continued to do so throughout her entire life. It was a point of pride and she would explain to anyone who would listen that doing so was something that she'd made great efforts to always do. 
She'd never questioned this decision until her five-year-old niece asked her, "So, is this why your life has been so difficult?" and Rhonda didn't have an answer for her.
